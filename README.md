# 👋 Hello! I'm Luis Rojas

🎯 **DevOps Engineer | Cloud Specialist | Christian Leader**

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a DevOps Engineer with over 6 years of experience in cloud platforms (Azure, AWS, GCP), containerized deployments with Docker and Kubernetes, and microservices using Node.js and Spring Boot. I am also deeply involved in mentoring technical teams, practicing TDD, and integrating automated testing into CI/CD workflows.

I’m passionate about creating efficient, resilient systems and helping others grow — not just technically, but personally and spiritually.
